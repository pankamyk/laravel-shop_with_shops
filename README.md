# Shop with shops

Laravel app, made entirely for my uni course.

Currently in development.

## Deps and build.

Clone repo, run "composer install", make .env and edit it to suit your needs, generate key.

Depends on composer (php, laravel and anything else will be automatically pulled by composer), some form of sql (you have to make and edit .env).
